# This project is not hosted on Microsoft GitHub anymore

**You can still find it at the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Groctel/) link in the project description.**

## Why did you remove your code from Microsoft GitHub?

Recent GitHub updates and overall company policy goes against my vision of open source projects.
This opinion is shared by [many people](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/), o I decided to move all my projects to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Groctel/).

Since this is a time of change, it is possible that I migrate my projects to a new forge.
I will update this and all the relevant pages with more than enough time should that happen.
Thank you for understanding.
